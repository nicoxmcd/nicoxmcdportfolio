## Takeaways
Some important things that I got out of it
⬆️ Identify your bottleneck and do work to improve that, because any work that's done to improve the system that ISN'T the bottleneck is just an illusion. Bottlenecks decrease throughput! 
💸 IT supports revenue generation in the business, it's not just there to fix broken things, it's there to also help achieve business goals.
🤖 Automate wherever possible to decrease risk and increase speed.
♻️ WIP is dangerous, too much work in progress can lead to too much context switching and causes delays and confusion.
📈 Lean mindset: eliminate waste, experiment, and optimize.

## The Three Ways (Core Principles)
1️⃣ Systems Thinking
Focus on the performance of the entire system, not individual areas.
Prioritize forward flow of work from Development → Operations → Customer.
2️⃣ Amplify Feedback Loops
Encourage communication between devs, ops, QA, and security to find and fix problems early-on and this leads to higher performance.
3️⃣ Culture of Continuous Learning and Experimentation
Embrace failure as a learning opportunity and focus on continual improvement.
