## Reflection

**Chunk 2** Building the API
1. What aspect of Chunk 2's work did I find the most difficult?
2. Note one or two problems I overcame to get the cloud function talking to your database; include the error messages or screenshots of the issues and write down what I did to fix them.
3. Did I implement one of the mods? Note the ones I chose and learned, how did I improve the project over the basic spec?
4. What's something I would have done differently, or added, if I had more time?

4. What something I added or would have done differently if I had more time?
