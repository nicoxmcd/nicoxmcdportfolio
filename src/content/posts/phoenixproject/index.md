## My Takeaways
- ⬆️ Identify your bottleneck and do work to improve that, because any work that's done to improve the system that ISN'T the bottleneck is just an illusion. Bottlenecks decrease throughput! 
- 💸 IT supports revenue generation in the business, it's not just there to fix broken things, it's there to also help achieve business goals.
- 🤖 Automate wherever possible to decrease risk and increase speed.
- ♻️ WIP is dangerous, too much work in progress can lead to too much context switching and causes delays and confusion.
- 📈 Lean mindset: eliminate waste, experiment, and optimize.
- ❗️ There's a big difference between being aware of potential risks and finding ways and countermeasures to mitigate them.
- ❌ Until the code is in production, no value is actually being generated; meaning big projects that aren't being regularly shipped in smaller increments are not operating at their full value.
- 🏃🏻‍♀️ Failing quickly allows you to learn quickly.
- ⛓️ Understand overall business goals and create value chains.

## The Three Ways (Core Principles)
- 1️⃣ Systems Thinking
    - Focus on the performance of the entire system, not individual areas.
    - Prioritize forward flow of work from Development → Operations → Customer.
    - Reduce cycle times.
- 2️⃣ Amplify Feedback Loops
    - Encourage communication between devs, ops, QA, and security to find and fix problems early-on and this leads to higher performance.
- 3️⃣ Culture of Continuous Learning and Experimentation
    - Embrace failure as a learning opportunity and focus on continual improvement.

> it's a really good book and you'll learn a lot without even knowing that you're learning because the plot is just that good 😄
