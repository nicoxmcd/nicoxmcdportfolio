After I finished the ExerQ project, I decided to obtain my first certification in AWS: Certified Cloud Practitioner. Overall, I think the project really helped me lay a lot of necessary foundations of the using the console and how many services operate.
:::

The time between finishing the project to passing the exam took **one month total**.

## Study Routine
- **Project Experience**
    - I used [Tiny Tech Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@TinyTechnicalTutorials) to help me in creating the ExerQ project, I ended up combining a lot of her tutorials in one big project. Her walkthroughs were very helpful. The whole project took about two weeks to complete, though I'm not including this in the study duration.
- **Prep Course**
    - Afterwards, I watched [Hiroko Nishimura's CLF-C02 Prep Course on LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=56742337&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fcollections%2F7329251988431380481%3Ftrk%3Dshare_collection_url%26shareId%3D%252B6S7%252BPd%252FRgi88kthYd0%252BXQ%253D%253D). She reinforced a lot of important concepts. You'll be able to understand the breakdown of a lot of services, support plans, and more. The total time for the course takes about **5 hours**. You can pretty much do one domain per day and take lots of good notes. I plan to add my notes to the blog after going through it again.
- **Cloud Quest**
    - [Cloud Quest](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-cloud-quest/) is a gamified learning experience on AWS, it takes you through real world labs where you can gain exposure to Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Auto Scaling, Load Balacing, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Simple Storage Service (S3), and more. The whole experience took me about a **week and a half to complete**. 
    - There's 16 labs that you have to complete with increasing difficulty. There's also fun side missions you can do to practice building architecture design and review concepts with multiple choice questions.
- **Quizlet**
    - I utilized multiple Quizlet to review important concepts to reinforce my understanding of support plans, various services, and specific use cases. I would include links, but there are many of them out there, so you should have no problem in finding a good one.
    - I studied these flashcards *all the time*, going through these is super effective in preparing for the exam experience.
- **Practice Exams**
    - There's a big difference between hands-on experience and preparing for an exam. That's why I really recommend building a small project and or completing the Cloud Quest labs, they will give you a lot of hands-on experience and understanding that practice exams can't deliver.
    - I used [Mohamed Ali's practice exams on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013ma3@ZfQSD_JRJcqgQ-QyHIsT_oHJz0ezzF0jTa1sLg-hHXK3gvNFzMapw5Zm_NoTIJ9e/), with a free Udemy account it's $20. These were very helpful becasue they have six practice exams with explanations for each question, each concept, and every correct and incorrect answer.
    - It's definitely worth it, you'll get used to the exam structure and answering questions within a time limit.
    - The explanations are also really comprehensive and fine-tune many concepts thatI was weaker in.
    - I reviewed each exam approximately three or four times each or until I was consistently getting over 90%

### Taking the Exam
- There were many concepts on the exam that I was surprised about, I quickly went through the whole thing, answering questions with my first gut-reaction and flagging ones that I was unsure about.
- I went through all the questions again and cut my *unsure* questions by half. I repeated that process until the flagged questions were about 10 or so.


:::tip[Areas for Improvement]
Other areas of DevOps and Software Development that I want to continue learning is creating projects that utilize tools to enhance scalability. It's important for delivering a seamless product to customers, so I want to gain more exposure into that.
I also want to implement more active monitoring solutions and understand traceability in AWS a lot more.
