This project is by no means complete, but adding these reflection question to answer them as I go

## Reflection
**Chunk 1** Building the front end
1. What are the top 2-3 areas of cloud that I feel least comfortable with right now?
2. What was my study routine like for the CPP?
3. What other areas of DevOps or software development do I want to get better at outside of cloud certification?

**Chunk 2** Building the API
1. What aspect of Chunk 2's work did I find the most difficult?
2. Note one or two problems I overcame to get the cloud function talking to your database; include the error messages or screenshots of the issues and write down what I did to fix them.
3. Did I implement one of the mods? Note the ones I chose and learned, how did I improve the project over the basic spec?
4. What's something I would have done differently, or added, if I had more time?

**Chunk 3** Full stack integration
1. What aspect of Chunk 3's work did I find the most difficult?
2. Note one or two problems I overcame to get the API talking to the browser, include the error messages or screenshots; include the error messages or screenshots of the issues, and write down what you did to fix them.
3. The mods in this section are fairly open-ended; if you chose one, how far did you go and why is it an improvement over the basic spec?
4. What something I added or would have done differently if I had more time?

**Chunk 4** Automation and CI
1. What aspects of Chunk 4's work did I find the most difficult?
2. Which IaC tool did I choose? Why?
3. Note one or two problems I overcame to get the cloud resources automatically deployed; include the error messages or screenshots of the issues and write down what I did to fix them
4. Both of the mods for this sections are long and gnarly. Each would be worth a blog on their own. Make sure to capture what steps I took and anything unusual I ran into
5. What's something I'd do differently with more time?

**Chunk 5** Blog
1. What's next?
