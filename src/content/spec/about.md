# About
Hello everybody, I'm Nicole! Welcome to my cloud portfolio.

In short, I got started in engineering in high school. At the time I wanted to become a orchestral musician and I did everything under the sun relating to music. When a [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) program started, I wanted to join, but I was met with opposition.

> *You don't have time, you can't learn programming*

And I stayed there and argued with the program teacher saying that I will *make time*. 

**Surprisingly**, I ended up finishing the entire program within 3 months. Both the Robotics and Girls Who Code teachers saw how passionate I was about solving problems and how much I loved programming. I was the Lead Programmer for our [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) [Team 2070](https://sites.google.com/view/team2070). As I was doing the electrical work alongside programming in Java, I wanted to pivot to Computer Engineering.

To this day I appreciate them both for giving me so many opportunities and encouraging me to pursue engineering. I started in engineering because I wanted to prove that *I could do it* and I *stayed* because I loved coming up with creative solutions. 

Throughout my college career, I worked simultaneously as a DevOps Engineer for SPHERE Technology Solutions. I learned so much, not just how to develop code, but how to manage, build, package, and ship it. I had so many amazing mentors and team members there and it was amazing to learn from them.

Right before I graduated I gained exposure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and I *really loved* cloud computing. There are so many benefits, resources, and tools to basically create anything you want. Following my graduation, I studied and built projects to support my AWS learning, and I got my first certification: AWS Cloud Practitioner! 

This portfolio was built as my version of the [AWS Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/), please enjoy and don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:nicolexmcdermott@proton.me) for any opportunities or inquiries.
