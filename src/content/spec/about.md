# About
Hello everybody, I'm Nicole! Welcome to my cloud portfolio, it's currently a work in progress as I move on to adding the view counter.

In short, I got started in engineering in high school. At the time I wanted to become a orchestral musician and I did everything under the sun relating to music. When a Girls Who Code program started, I wanted to join, but I was met with opposition because I wouldn't be able to attend the meetings after school.

> You don't have time, you can't learn programming

And I stayed there and argued with the program teacher saying that I will *make time*. 

> And I did learn

Every day, I took my lunch in the Robotics classroom to do the modules and quickly engulfed myself in problem solving and finding complex solutions. 

Surprisingly, I ended up finishing the entire program within 3 months. Both the Robotics and Girls Who Code teacher saw how passionate I was about solving problems and how much I loved programming. I was asked to be the Lead Programmer for the First Robotics Competition team (2070). It was a fun experience learning LabVIEW and eventually switching over Java to use object oriented programming. At first I leaned more towards Computer Science and Cyber Security; but eventually as I was doing the electrical work as one of the team captains, I wanted to pivot to Computer Engineering.

To this day I appreciate them both for giving me so many opportunities and encouraging me to pursue engineering. I started in engineering because I wanted to prove that *I could do it* and I stayed because I loved coming up with creative solutions. 

Throughout my college career, I worked simultaneously as a DevOps Engineer for SPHERE Technology Solutions. I learned so much, not just how to develop code, but how to manage, build, package, and ship it. I had so many amazing mentors and team members there and it was amazing to learn from them.

Right before I graduated I gained exposure to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and I *really* **loved** cloud computing. There are so many benefits, resources, and tools to basically create anything you want. Following my graduation, I studied and built projects to support my AWS learning, and I got my first certification: AWS Cloud Practitioner!
